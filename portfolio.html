      <b>My review:</b>
      <p>At first, this project was challenging. I did not think that I would be able to do the job alotted to me by my team members. I began to shine through this situation when when I was able to populate multiple news articles into a div, or a section. Though this may be a small feat for some, this hands-on knowledge helped me to expand upon my skills during my sixth homework assignment. </p>

      <b>My review:</b>
      <p>Here, I expanded upon my skills. I consider this to be the homework assignment I worked the hardest on for this boot camp </p>
      <p>within the shortest amount of time. It was also the most enjoyable assignment I have had. I continued the skills I had learned in Project 1 and </p>
      <p>2.</p>

      <b>My review:</b>
      <p>This is where I entered the wonderful world of javascript express. In laymans term, this is when an individual is able to call a </p>
      <p>localhost in the search engine rather than entering a url. With the vscode app and git bash, one basically connects the application to the </p>
      <p>localhost address by calling it in the server.js. This took about a month for me to figure out, but when I did, it was my next big step </p>
      <p>in understanding the class material and excelling as a developer.</p>

      <h5>Project 2 ("FilmStache", which I completed with my colleagues Alex, Georgette, Gabriel, Patrick, and Ella.)</h5>

      <b>My review:</b>
      <p>Though my five colleagues and I did work very hard on this project, we still want to expand upon this in the future. Using a web API, we created an application in which one can log in their favorite movies, write reviews, and see ratings. In the future, we want the user to be able to rate it by his or herself, watch trailers, and expand the options from what the API gives us. Georgette, Gabriel, and I put together the phenomenal front-end work that you see before you. </p>
      <p>Though my first project (the one with the Google Maps API for National Parks) was the most rigorous, I was able to make a lasting contribution to this one and it was by far the most personally enjoyable.</p>
